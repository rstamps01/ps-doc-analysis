## Required Google Cloud APIs

The Enhanced Information Validation Tool integrates with multiple Google Cloud services to provide comprehensive document validation capabilities. Each API serves a specific purpose in the validation workflow and requires proper enablement and configuration.

### Google Sheets API v4

The Google Sheets API v4 is the primary interface for accessing and analyzing Google Sheets documents containing Site Survey data and Install Plan information [1]. This API enables the validation tool to read spreadsheet content, analyze document structure, validate data completeness, and extract technical requirements for processing.

The Sheets API provides essential functionality including reading cell values and ranges, accessing worksheet metadata and structure, detecting data schemas and formats, validating required fields and sections, and extracting validation criteria from spreadsheets. Without proper Sheets API access, the validation tool cannot perform its core function of analyzing Site Survey Part 1, Site Survey Part 2, and Install Plan documents.

The API requires specific scopes for different levels of access. Read-only access requires the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly` scope, while read-write access for updating validation status requires the broader `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` scope [2]. For the Enhanced Information Validation Tool, both scopes are recommended to enable full functionality including status updates and validation result recording.

### Google Drive API v3

The Google Drive API v3 provides file management and access capabilities essential for document processing workflows [3]. This API enables the validation tool to access shared documents, download files for processing, manage file permissions and sharing, and integrate with organizational Drive structures.

Key Drive API capabilities include listing and searching for files, accessing file metadata and properties, downloading file content for analysis, managing file permissions and sharing settings, and creating folders for organized document storage. The Drive API is particularly important for accessing documents shared through Google Drive links and managing the document validation workflow.

The Drive API requires specific scopes including `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` for read-only access to files and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` for managing files created by the application [4]. For comprehensive document access, the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` scope provides full Drive access, though this should be used judiciously following the principle of least privilege.

### Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) API

The IAM API is essential for managing service account permissions and ensuring secure access to Google Cloud resources [5]. While not directly used by the validation tool's core functionality, proper IAM configuration is critical for security and access management.

The IAM API enables management of service account keys and permissions, configuration of role-based access controls, monitoring and auditing of API access, and implementation of security best practices. Proper IAM configuration ensures that the service account has exactly the permissions needed for validation operations without excessive privileges.

### API Enablement Requirements

All required APIs must be enabled in the Google Cloud Console before the service account can access them. The APIs can be enabled through the Google Cloud Console API Library, the gcloud command-line tool, or programmatically through the Service Management API [6].

| API Name | API Identifier | Required Scopes | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Google Sheets API v4 | `sheets.googleapis.com` | `spreadsheets.readonly`, `spreadsheets` | Document analysis and validation |
| Google Drive API v3 | `drive.googleapis.com` | `drive.readonly`, `drive.file` | File access and management |
| Google Cloud IAM API | `iam.googleapis.com` | N/A (administrative) | Service account management |

The API enablement process typically takes a few minutes to propagate across Google's infrastructure. During this time, API requests may return authentication errors even with correct credentials. It's recommended to wait 5-10 minutes after enabling APIs before testing service account access.


## Service Account Permissions

Service account permissions for the Enhanced Information Validation Tool must be carefully configured to provide necessary access while maintaining security best practices. The permissions are divided into Google Cloud IAM roles and API-specific scopes that govern what resources the service account can access.

### Required IAM Roles

The service account requires specific IAM roles to function properly within the Google Cloud environment. These roles provide the foundational permissions needed for API access and resource management.

**Service Account User Role** (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) is essential for the service account to authenticate and access Google Cloud APIs [7]. This role allows the service account to act on behalf of the application and make authenticated API requests. Without this role, the service account cannot perform any operations, regardless of other permissions granted.

**Service Account Token Creator Role** (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`) enables the service account to create access tokens for API authentication [8]. This role is particularly important when the service account needs to generate short-lived tokens for secure API access. The token creator role ensures that the validation tool can maintain secure, time-limited access to Google APIs.

**Project Viewer Role** (`roles/viewer`) provides read-only access to project resources and is recommended for monitoring and debugging purposes [9]. While not strictly required for core functionality, this role enables better error reporting and troubleshooting by allowing the service account to access project metadata and resource information.

### API-Specific Permissions

Beyond IAM roles, the service account requires specific API permissions configured through OAuth 2.0 scopes. These scopes define exactly what actions the service account can perform with each Google API.

**Google Sheets API Permissions** must include both read and write capabilities to support the full validation workflow. The `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly` scope provides read-only access to all spreadsheets that the service account has been granted access to [10]. This scope is sufficient for reading document content and performing validation analysis.

For enhanced functionality, the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` scope provides full read-write access to spreadsheets [11]. This broader scope enables the validation tool to update spreadsheets with validation results, add comments or annotations, and modify document status fields. The read-write scope is recommended for production deployments where validation results need to be recorded back to the source documents.

**Google Drive API Permissions** should be configured based on the specific document access patterns required by your organization. The `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` scope provides read-only access to all Drive files that the service account can access [12]. This scope is appropriate for validation workflows that only need to read document content without modifying files.

For more comprehensive document management, the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` scope allows the service account to access and modify files that it has created or that have been explicitly shared with it [13]. This scope provides a good balance between functionality and security by limiting access to relevant files only.

The broadest permission level, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`, provides full access to all Drive files accessible to the service account [14]. While this scope offers maximum functionality, it should be used cautiously and only when necessary, following the principle of least privilege.

### Document Access Permissions

In addition to API-level permissions, the service account must be granted access to specific documents or folders containing the Site Survey and Install Plan documents. This access is managed through Google Drive's sharing mechanisms and is separate from the API permissions.

**Individual Document Sharing** involves sharing each document directly with the service account's email address. The service account email follows the format `service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com` [15]. Documents can be shared with "Viewer" or "Editor" permissions depending on whether the validation tool needs to modify the documents.

**Folder-Level Sharing** is more efficient for organizations with many documents. By sharing a parent folder with the service account, all contained documents inherit the access permissions [16]. This approach simplifies permission management and ensures that new documents added to the folder are automatically accessible to the validation tool.

**Domain-Wide Delegation** is an advanced configuration option that allows the service account to impersonate users within a Google Workspace domain [17]. This approach requires domain administrator privileges to configure but provides seamless access to documents across the organization without individual sharing requirements.

### Permission Validation Matrix

The following matrix shows the relationship between different permission levels and available functionality:

| Functionality | Sheets Readonly | Sheets Full | Drive Readonly | Drive File | Drive Full |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| Read document content | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Analyze document structure | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Update validation status | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | Limited | ✓ |
| Create validation reports | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Access all shared documents | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Limited | ✓ |
| Modify document permissions | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

### Security Considerations

Service account permissions should be regularly reviewed and audited to ensure they align with current requirements and security policies. Over-privileged service accounts represent a significant security risk and should be avoided [18].

**Principle of Least Privilege** dictates that service accounts should have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended functions. For the Enhanced Information Validation Tool, this typically means using read-only scopes unless write access is explicitly required for the validation workflow.

**Permission Rotation** involves periodically reviewing and updating service account permissions to remove unnecessary access and ensure alignment with current business requirements. This practice helps prevent privilege creep and reduces the attack surface of compromised service accounts.

**Access Monitoring** through Google Cloud's audit logs provides visibility into service account usage and can help identify unusual or unauthorized access patterns [19]. Regular monitoring of service account activity is essential for maintaining security and compliance.


## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Setting up a Google Cloud service account for the Enhanced Information Validation Tool requires careful attention to detail and proper configuration of multiple components. This section provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions that will guide you through the entire setup process, from initial project creation to final testing and validation.

### Prerequisites and Initial Setup

Before beginning the service account setup process, ensure that you have the necessary access and tools in place. You will need administrative access to a Google Cloud Platform project, either as a project owner or with sufficient IAM permissions to create and manage service accounts [20]. If you don't have an existing Google Cloud project, you'll need to create one specifically for the Enhanced Information Validation Tool.

**Google Cloud Console Access** is the primary interface for managing service accounts and API configurations. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com and sign in with your Google account. Ensure that you have access to the project where you want to create the service account, or create a new project if necessary [21].

**Project Selection and Configuration** begins with selecting the appropriate Google Cloud project from the project dropdown in the console header. If you need to create a new project, click on the project dropdown and select "New Project." Provide a meaningful project name such as "Enhanced-Validation-Tool" and optionally specify a project ID and organization. The project ID must be globally unique and cannot be changed after creation [22].

**Billing Account Setup** is required for API usage, even though the Enhanced Information Validation Tool typically falls within Google's free tier limits for most use cases. Navigate to the Billing section in the Google Cloud Console and ensure that a valid billing account is associated with your project. Without a billing account, you cannot enable APIs or create service accounts [23].

### Creating the Service Account

The service account creation process involves several steps that must be completed in the correct order to ensure proper functionality. Begin by navigating to the IAM & Admin section in the Google Cloud Console, then select "Service Accounts" from the left navigation menu.

**Service Account Creation** starts with clicking the "Create Service Account" button at the top of the Service Accounts page. You'll be presented with a form requiring several pieces of information that will define your service account's identity and initial configuration.

**Service Account Details** must be carefully configured to ensure proper identification and management. In the "Service account name" field, enter a descriptive name such as "enhanced-validation-tool-sa" or "document-validator-service." This name will be used to identify the service account in logs and administrative interfaces. The service account ID will be automatically generated based on the name you provide, but you can modify it if needed. The ID must be between 6 and 30 characters and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens [24].

**Service Account Description** should provide clear information about the service account's purpose and usage. Enter a description such as "Service account for Enhanced Information Validation Tool - provides access to Google Sheets and Drive APIs for document validation and analysis." This description will help other administrators understand the service account's purpose and appropriate usage.

**Service Account Permissions** configuration occurs in the second step of the creation process. Here you'll assign the IAM roles that define what the service account can do within your Google Cloud project. Click "Continue" to proceed to the permissions configuration step.

### Configuring IAM Roles

The IAM roles configuration is critical for ensuring that your service account has the appropriate permissions to function while maintaining security best practices. The roles you assign here will determine what Google Cloud resources the service account can access and what actions it can perform.

**Basic Role Assignment** begins with the "Grant this service account access to project" section. While you could assign broad roles like "Project Editor" or "Project Viewer," it's better to follow the principle of least privilege and assign only the specific roles needed for the validation tool's functionality.

**Service Account User Role** should be assigned first, as it provides the fundamental permissions needed for the service account to authenticate and operate. In the "Select a role" dropdown, search for and select "Service Account User" (roles/iam.serviceAccountUser). This role allows the service account to act on behalf of the application and make authenticated API requests [25].

**Additional Role Configuration** may be necessary depending on your specific use case and security requirements. If your validation tool needs to create access tokens dynamically, also assign the "Service Account Token Creator" role (roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator). For basic monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities, consider adding the "Project Viewer" role (roles/viewer), though this is optional and should be evaluated based on your security policies [26].

**Custom Role Considerations** may be appropriate for organizations with strict security requirements. Instead of using predefined roles, you can create custom roles that include only the specific permissions needed by the Enhanced Information Validation Tool. Custom roles require careful planning and understanding of the exact permissions needed, but they provide the highest level of security control [27].

### Enabling Required APIs

API enablement is a crucial step that must be completed before your service account can access Google Sheets and Drive functionality. Each API must be explicitly enabled in your Google Cloud project, and the enablement process can take several minutes to propagate across Google's infrastructure.

**API Library Navigation** begins by accessing the API Library through the Google Cloud Console. From the main console navigation, select "APIs & Services" and then click on "Library." This will display the comprehensive catalog of available Google APIs that can be enabled for your project.

**Google Sheets API Enablement** is the first API you'll need to enable. In the API Library search box, type "Google Sheets API" and select the official Google Sheets API v4 from the search results. Click on the API to view its details page, which provides information about the API's capabilities, pricing, and usage quotas. Click the "Enable" button to enable the API for your project [28].

**Google Drive API Enablement** follows the same process as the Sheets API. Search for "Google Drive API" in the API Library and select the Google Drive API v3 from the results. Review the API details to understand its capabilities and quotas, then click "Enable" to activate the API for your project [29].

**API Enablement Verification** can be confirmed by navigating to the "APIs & Services" dashboard in the Google Cloud Console. This dashboard shows all enabled APIs for your project, along with usage statistics and quota information. Verify that both the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API appear in the list of enabled APIs with "Enabled" status.

**Quota and Billing Considerations** should be reviewed for each enabled API. Google provides generous free quotas for both the Sheets and Drive APIs that are typically sufficient for most validation tool deployments. However, high-volume usage may require quota increases or result in additional charges. Review the quota limits and set up billing alerts if necessary to monitor usage [30].

### Generating Service Account Keys

Service account keys are the credentials that your Enhanced Information Validation Tool will use to authenticate with Google APIs. These keys must be generated, downloaded, and securely stored to enable proper authentication.

**Key Generation Process** begins by returning to the Service Accounts page in the Google Cloud Console and locating the service account you created. Click on the service account name to access its details page, which provides comprehensive information about the service account's configuration and keys.

**JSON Key Creation** is the recommended approach for most applications, including the Enhanced Information Validation Tool. In the service account details page, navigate to the "Keys" tab and click "Add Key," then select "Create new key." Choose "JSON" as the key type, as this format is widely supported and includes all necessary authentication information in a single file [31].

**Key Download and Storage** occurs immediately after key creation. Google will generate the key and automatically download it to your computer as a JSON file. This file contains sensitive authentication information and should be treated as a secret. The filename will typically follow the format "project-id-service-account-key.json" with a unique identifier.

**Key Security Considerations** are paramount when handling service account keys. The downloaded JSON file contains all the information needed to authenticate as your service account, so it must be protected accordingly. Never commit service account keys to version control systems, share them via email or messaging platforms, or store them in publicly accessible locations [32].

### Configuring Document Access

Service account access to Google Sheets and Drive documents requires explicit sharing permissions, as service accounts don't automatically have access to documents in your organization. This configuration step is essential for the validation tool to access the Site Survey and Install Plan documents it needs to process.

**Service Account Email Identification** is the first step in configuring document access. Your service account has an email address that follows the format "service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com." You can find this email address in the service account details page in the Google Cloud Console. Copy this email address, as you'll need it for sharing documents and folders.

**Individual Document Sharing** involves sharing each Site Survey and Install Plan document directly with the service account email address. Open each document in Google Sheets or Google Drive, click the "Share" button, and enter the service account email address. Grant appropriate permissions based on your validation tool's requirements - "Viewer" permissions are sufficient for read-only validation, while "Editor" permissions are needed if the tool will update validation status or add comments [33].

**Folder-Based Sharing** is more efficient for organizations with multiple documents or ongoing document creation. Create a dedicated folder in Google Drive for validation documents, share this folder with the service account email address, and ensure that all relevant documents are stored within this folder. Documents added to the shared folder will automatically inherit the sharing permissions, reducing ongoing administrative overhead [34].

**Organizational Considerations** may require coordination with your Google Workspace administrator if you're using domain-managed accounts. Some organizations have policies that restrict sharing with external accounts, including service accounts. Work with your IT team to ensure that the service account can access necessary documents while complying with organizational security policies.

### Testing Service Account Configuration

Thorough testing of your service account configuration is essential to ensure that the Enhanced Information Validation Tool will function correctly in production. This testing should verify API access, document permissions, and authentication functionality.

**Authentication Testing** can be performed using Google's client libraries or command-line tools. The simplest approach is to use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command-line tool to test authentication. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to point to your downloaded service account key file, then run commands like "gcloud auth application-default print-access-token" to verify that authentication is working correctly [35].

**API Access Verification** should test both Google Sheets and Drive API functionality. You can use Google's API Explorer or write simple test scripts to verify that your service account can access the APIs with the configured permissions. Test basic operations like listing accessible spreadsheets or Drive files to confirm that the API enablement and permissions are working as expected.

**Document Access Testing** involves attempting to access specific documents that have been shared with your service account. Use the Google Sheets API to read data from a test spreadsheet or the Drive API to list files in a shared folder. This testing will confirm that the document sharing configuration is correct and that your service account can access the documents it needs to process [36].

**Error Handling and Troubleshooting** should be tested by intentionally creating error conditions, such as attempting to access documents that haven't been shared with the service account or calling APIs that haven't been enabled. This testing helps ensure that your validation tool will handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages when configuration issues occur.


## Security Best Practices

Implementing robust security practices for your Google Cloud service account is essential for protecting your organization's data and maintaining compliance with security policies. Service accounts represent a significant security consideration because they provide programmatic access to Google APIs and can potentially access sensitive documents and data.

**Key Management Security** forms the foundation of service account security. The JSON key file downloaded during service account creation contains all the information needed to authenticate as your service account, making it equivalent to a password that never expires. Store this key file in a secure location with appropriate access controls, such as a dedicated secrets management system or encrypted storage with restricted access permissions [37].

**Environment Variable Configuration** is the recommended approach for providing service account credentials to your Enhanced Information Validation Tool. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to point to the path of your service account key file, rather than hardcoding the path in your application code. This approach prevents accidental exposure of credential paths in code repositories and makes it easier to manage different credentials across development, staging, and production environments [38].

**Key Rotation Policies** should be established to regularly refresh service account keys and limit the impact of potential key compromise. Google Cloud allows multiple keys to exist simultaneously for a single service account, enabling zero-downtime key rotation. Implement a policy to rotate service account keys at least annually, or more frequently if required by your organization's security policies. Document the rotation process and ensure that all team members understand how to perform key rotation safely [39].

**Access Monitoring and Auditing** provides visibility into service account usage and helps detect unauthorized or unusual access patterns. Enable Google Cloud audit logging for your project to capture detailed information about API calls made by your service account. Regularly review audit logs to identify any unexpected usage patterns, failed authentication attempts, or access to unauthorized resources. Set up alerting for suspicious activities such as API calls from unexpected IP addresses or unusual usage volumes [40].

**Principle of Least Privilege Implementation** requires ongoing attention to ensure that service account permissions remain aligned with actual requirements. Regularly review and audit the IAM roles and API scopes assigned to your service account, removing any permissions that are no longer needed. Consider implementing time-bound permissions for temporary access requirements and use custom IAM roles to provide exactly the permissions needed without over-privileging the service account [41].

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Service account configuration and usage can encounter various issues that may prevent the Enhanced Information Validation Tool from functioning correctly. Understanding common problems and their solutions will help you quickly resolve issues and maintain reliable operation.

**Authentication Failures** are among the most common issues encountered when setting up service accounts. These failures typically manifest as "401 Unauthorized" errors when attempting to access Google APIs. The most frequent cause is incorrect configuration of the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable or an invalid or corrupted service account key file [42].

To troubleshoot authentication failures, first verify that the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable is set correctly and points to a valid JSON key file. Check that the key file is readable by the application and that the JSON format is valid. If you suspect the key file may be corrupted, generate a new key from the Google Cloud Console and test with the fresh key file.

**API Access Denied Errors** typically occur when the required APIs haven't been enabled for your Google Cloud project or when the service account lacks necessary IAM permissions. These errors usually present as "403 Forbidden" responses with messages indicating that the API is not enabled or access is denied [43].

Resolve API access issues by verifying that both the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API are enabled in your project through the Google Cloud Console API Library. Check that the service account has been assigned appropriate IAM roles, particularly the Service Account User role. If you're using custom IAM roles, ensure they include all necessary permissions for the APIs you're trying to access.

**Document Access Problems** occur when the service account cannot access specific Google Sheets or Drive documents, even though API access is working correctly. These issues typically result in "404 Not Found" errors when attempting to access documents or empty results when listing accessible files [44].

Document access problems are usually caused by sharing configuration issues. Verify that the documents or folders containing your validation documents have been shared with the service account's email address. Check that the sharing permissions are appropriate for your use case - "Viewer" permissions for read-only access or "Editor" permissions if the validation tool needs to modify documents. For organizations using Google Workspace, ensure that sharing with external accounts (including service accounts) is permitted by domain policies.

**Quota and Rate Limiting Issues** can occur when your validation tool exceeds the usage limits for Google APIs. These issues typically present as "429 Too Many Requests" errors or "403 Quota Exceeded" responses. Google provides generous free quotas for most use cases, but high-volume processing or inefficient API usage patterns can trigger these limits [45].

Address quota issues by reviewing your API usage patterns and implementing appropriate rate limiting in your validation tool. Consider batching API requests where possible and implementing exponential backoff retry logic for rate-limited requests. If legitimate usage requirements exceed the free quotas, you may need to request quota increases through the Google Cloud Console or optimize your API usage patterns to stay within limits.

**Network and Connectivity Problems** can prevent your validation tool from reaching Google APIs, particularly in corporate environments with restrictive firewall policies or proxy servers. These issues typically result in connection timeout errors or DNS resolution failures [46].

Troubleshoot network issues by verifying that your environment can reach Google's API endpoints (*.googleapis.com) on port 443. Check firewall rules and proxy configurations that might be blocking outbound HTTPS connections. If your organization uses a corporate proxy, ensure that the validation tool is configured to use the proxy for API requests.

## Testing and Validation

Comprehensive testing of your Google Cloud service account configuration ensures that the Enhanced Information Validation Tool will function reliably in production. This testing should cover authentication, API access, document permissions, and error handling scenarios.

**Authentication Testing** verifies that your service account can successfully authenticate with Google Cloud services. Use the Google Cloud SDK to test authentication by setting the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable and running authentication commands. The command "gcloud auth application-default print-access-token" should return a valid access token if authentication is configured correctly [47].

For programmatic testing, create a simple script that uses Google's client libraries to authenticate and make a basic API call. This approach tests the complete authentication flow that your validation tool will use in production. Test both successful authentication scenarios and error conditions, such as invalid key files or missing environment variables, to ensure proper error handling.

**API Functionality Testing** should verify that your service account can successfully access both the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API with the configured permissions. Create test scripts that perform basic operations like listing accessible spreadsheets, reading cell data from a test sheet, listing Drive files, and downloading file metadata [48].

Test different permission levels to ensure that your service account has appropriate access. If you've configured read-only permissions, verify that write operations are properly denied. If you need write access, test document modification operations to ensure they work correctly. Document any limitations or unexpected behaviors for future reference.

**Document Access Validation** confirms that your service account can access the specific documents it needs to process. Create test documents that mirror the structure and sharing configuration of your actual Site Survey and Install Plan documents. Share these test documents with your service account and verify that the validation tool can access and process them correctly [49].

Test both individual document sharing and folder-based sharing scenarios to ensure that your chosen access model works as expected. Verify that new documents added to shared folders are automatically accessible to the service account. Test access to documents with different permission levels to understand how permissions affect the validation tool's functionality.

**Error Handling and Recovery Testing** ensures that your validation tool can gracefully handle various error conditions and provide meaningful feedback when issues occur. Intentionally create error scenarios such as accessing non-existent documents, exceeding API quotas, or using invalid authentication credentials [50].

Test network connectivity issues by temporarily blocking access to Google APIs and verifying that your validation tool handles connection failures appropriately. Test permission-related errors by temporarily removing document sharing or API permissions and ensuring that error messages are clear and actionable.

**Performance and Scalability Testing** evaluates how your service account configuration performs under realistic usage conditions. Test the validation tool with multiple documents of varying sizes to understand performance characteristics and identify any bottlenecks. Monitor API usage patterns and response times to ensure that your configuration can handle expected production workloads [51].

Consider testing with concurrent operations to understand how your service account performs when processing multiple documents simultaneously. This testing is particularly important if you plan to deploy the validation tool in environments with high document processing volumes.
